# This shop project represents my knowledge of React.js and Node.js

##### Application works like this, we have a registration and login system. User can be admin or not. Each user can add their ads to the application. He can edit or delete his ads. He can also change his profile information like username, email, address, gender, city, and password. All ads are listed on the shop page where users can sort via price. Each ad has a single page where information is displayed and the user can add one or more to the basket. The basket contains all ads that have been added with information such as name, price, quantity, and a trash icon if the user wants to delete the ad from the basket. On the myAds page, the user can see all his ads.

#### The project isn't done, I am working on him in my free time.
